However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM. It\\'s audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin. With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.

We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination. Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly. My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.

I bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets, six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick-style transformer plugs. I did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration, and this unit always came up. It has worked just fine for the month or so I've owned it. I particularly appreciate the angled plug, which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem.I only have two quibbles with the APC--the color and the stiffness caused by the plug-activated safety shutters.

Indeed, if the Democratic Party returns to power, the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.

I can't say I necessarily agree with her -- for starters, the private sector's influence on public policy and decision-making is nowhere near as entertaining as Mister Mistofellees' song and dance -- but who am I to argue with an old woman? Nobody, that's who\", \"this book sucks you in from page one! it's entertaining and witty! no need for more detail\", \"This is the real story about wall street firms and the way they look at their clients.

The little boy telling the story and the intricacy of politics attached to the story make this novel a book you cannot put aside. This is about an era of American history, and it is well documented. I recommend it to everyone: the older generation who lived thru it and particularly to the younger generation of people who are not familiar with this period; it teaches that history is constantly in the remake and cultural differences are still a problem in our world.', \"Lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach ,used by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of ,primarily, on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers. This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League division,but no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.First,James's system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem\", 'I finally know what makes for good comic book inks after reading this book. Gary Martin comprehensively outlines all the elements of comic book inking including the various techniques, styles and methods that the pros use. Plenty of samples from his own work and that of others. If you want to learn how to ink comic book art or you just want to know what distinguishes good inking from bad, I highly recommend this book. The production values, art and cover are also very professional', \"I am a longtime Jance fan and wasn't disappointed with Dead Wrong. Any complaints would be the overemphasis on Joanna's pregnancy with a concomitant under-emphasis on tension and suspense (great ending, though!). Butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book, but also comes across as overly self-absorbed, especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child. Jenny, too has little to add to the story. But Joanna shines, as usual. Nice to see such a reliable, ethical, and strong female protagonist\", \"Don't get me wrong this was a really good book. And I am so close to giving it 5 stars. It was just a little too short for me. The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core.

Just my opnion, I could be wrong\", 'I liked this book because it was quick and easy to read, but also had more in-depth information in the back.

I like that I know a reputable hospital stands behind the book, as well. I have 6 pregnancy books, but this one is my favorite', \"Background I read Isaac's Storm, by Erik Larson, around 1998. Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review. Larson covered three killer hurricanes, two killer blizzards and one flash flood. Galveston and related Hurricanes My first impression was that anyone who had read this book, about a major hurricane, would never consider riding out such a storm. Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters. Isaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time. This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm. This hit the island in September 1900, with very little warning. Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general, and Issac Cline, their station chief for this area, in\", \"Terrier will not disappoint Tamora Pierce fans! The narration is done through first person, told as a journal. This is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story, and difficult to account for actions the narrator hasn't seen. But Tamora has performed her usual magic, snatching up the readers' interest from the first page and holding it until the last (I even read all of the notes pages and the bio). Readers may find it difficult to put down. Once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo\", 'This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough \"inside details\" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham\\'s writings makes for a very enjoyable read.One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an', 'I bought this book because my mother is dying and I needed to know more. Kessler has a wonderful way of delivering this knowledge. He is thorough in imparting this knowledge and does so with total compassion for the dying and the living. I underscored many passages in this work and especially appreciated someone telling me (chapter 8) what can I expect in the way of physical signs as mom goes through the dying process. This book is very user friendly having a very readable quality. I strongly recommend it', 'This collection of stories and essays by David Sedaris definitely contains a lot of variety. Overall, I found the way the stories were dripping with sarcasm delightful. Some stories were a bit dry, but others such as \"SantaLand Diaries\" and \"Diary of a Smoker\" had me laughing out load. However, the best stories I found were the ones such \"Season\\'s Greetings to our Friends and Family!!!\" which I had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor. I would definitely like to read more of Sedaris\\' works, especially those based on his real-life experiences as, overall, I found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories', \"Guys and Dolls is a fantastic musical, and this vocal selections book is a good representation of it. Unfortunately, some songs like Marry The Man Today, My Time Of Day, Follow The Fold and The Oldest Established have been left out from the book, but that is the price you pay, or rather don't pay, when you don't buy the full vocal score. However, this book will satisfy fans of the show, complete with pictures from the original 1950 Broadway production, the 1955 film, and the New 1992 Broadway Revival.

And there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys. Neil Gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize. In this novel, gods (which represent animals) roam the earth in the bodies of humans. The main character is the clever, trouble-loving spider who interacts with other animal-gods in everyday human life. This book, along with other science fiction books, has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination. The strong point of this novel is the humor employed by Neil Gaiman. On par with Douglas Adams, the author of Anasi Boys fills the pages with quirky,', \"Wow..I LOVE this book! The recipes are creative and the presentations beautiful. I love the simplicity of each recipe, which give the warmth and richness of traditional old fashioned taste with a twist of the class &amp; sophistication of today's refined culinary experience!

Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE. The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span. Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come', 'A very straight forward book by Jim Otto. There is a price when one wants to achieve or aspire to achieve glory on the gridiron. Jim Otto is that person and he candidly tells us what he was willing to sacrifice to reach that plateau.

The usual well-planned mystery to solve, and more about three of my favorite characters, Joe, Jim, and Bernie who appreciate the desert so much', 'In this fascinating collection of essays, Dr. Dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis. Over the last twenty-five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies, an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms, subsidised housing, free by-weekly pay checks, child support and free medical benefits. From a liberal political standpoint, this support for the nation\\'s \"have nots\" is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor. One would logically assume that providing the poor with life\\'s essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society. In fact, as Dalrymple proposes, it has had an opposite effect: crime in his native England has skyrocketed; drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence. Why?', \"This is a pretty good book. However, I would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of Lincoln's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective\", 'A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship. Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him. It\\'s a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as \"Maximum Bob\" and \"Stick\" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick).I thought this was his best since \"Striptease.\" The intervening', \"I really don't understand all the negative reviews about this book.

The story centers on Pei, who as a young girl, is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory. The story evolves as Pei befriends other women in the silk factory, participates in a strike for fair working conditions, reconnects with her family, loses loved ones, and escapes from advancing Japanese soldiers. The plot is succinct and the characters are interesting, varied, and believable, if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth. Socio-cultural aspects of life in 1920s-30s China are elegantly woven into the plot. Themes of friendship, love, and courage are convincingly presented. Overall, the book is a captivating read, and strongly recommended.', \"This thing sat on my shelf, half-read for the longest time. Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again. It's not that it isn't brilliant. No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder. The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you'll ever read.And it's not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into. There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity's Rainbow before catching the wave.

I bought the book a few days ago, mainly because I like David Corn. When I read it I was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is. I think along with the two books I mentioned earlier, this trio make up the essential reading on Bush, Iraq, and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories.

As Director of Trader Development at a large proprietary trading house, I have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders. Moreover, this is a scalable difference: risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades, results of trading days, and performance across entire quarters. Where I believe Grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply \"cutting your losses\". Trading Risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades, from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades', 'Once again I am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject.

Given the rarity and fragility of Vermeer's works, it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated.

We have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions, therapy dogs, even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world. The notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new, but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of \"the greatest generation\" is new (at least to me).Mr.', \"Quirky and creative pictorial portrayel of man's best friend.

And a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing, and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity. I'm not sure the mail order chapter should have been included. Quite frankly, I think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here.

Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure. But the Roeblings' gaps in knowledge also worked against them.

I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.

He explains that they have little role in the development of culture (which he sees as passing from society to society from Mesopotamia on, like some sort of conceptual Olympic torch) and some get it and others do not. It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing. That said, the book contains marvelous elements.

The mid-first century of Rome was such a time and Tacitus was such a communicator. The Histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history. The historian will do well to read Tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity. While observing and commenting on the human element in history, Tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil, wars, and rumors of wars. His beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion', 'Philbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references.

The highlight is undoubtedly Andrew's excellent discussion of the great French critic Andre Bazin, which is not surprising since Andrew's Ph.D thesis was on Bazin. The weaknesses: This was published in 1976, and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then, especially feminism, and the influence of Lacan and psychoanalytic theory.

He masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of Latin America from Spain. The book starts in Rio de La Plata and ends in Mexico and Central America. Curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by Spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the Creole ruling class. The reluctance of Spanish Monarchy (and later even of liberals) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the Creoles (Spanish born in America).

As Rogers clearly points out, most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon. An inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors. In the early 1600\\'s Spinoza correctly determined the existence of an emotional balance. He told us that one extreme emotion will dominate the senses until such time that an equally extreme opposite emotion brings us back to emotional center. Antonio Damasio provides a compelling case that consciousness is inextricably linked to emotion in his book \"The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness\".

It explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no-win situation, resulting in a feeling of frustration, impotence, incompetence, and depression. The only socially acceptable way to express it is rage (even though rage is vilified, I can tell you that showing hurt, pain and weakness invites scorn, distain and disrespect, even from those who purport to love us). By explaining how we get into this trap, it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out. I wish I could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world.

His views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process, if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers.

By figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics, crossword puzzles, or other word grids, the cartoon humor is revealed. For the most part, the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty, although there are a few difficult ones (at least for me) that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist's career.

I picked it up because Walter Laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism. Written in 1886, it suggests that there is a pan-European anarchist underground, which the protagonist gets mixed up with. It is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy, who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction.

Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking.

It encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions, addictions, co-dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes.In this volume, John Bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families. He also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics.Through affirmations, working with feelings, visualizations and other techniques, the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame.

Collins seems to delight in making her as full-bodied, as attractive to men, and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire. Given the tenor and social conventions of the time, her quest for revenge on the despicable Alan Armadale seems perfectly in keeping.

Every person is fleshed out within the context of the story, and flashbacks are only used when absolutely necessary. I never felt like the story was on hold while I learned about someone's childhood.

Christine Korsgaard fixes, at least for me, this problem, by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality.

This one is short and for once I would have liked a book a bit wordier.Anyhow, the narrator, a sort of mad tinkerer, describes his visit 800,000+ years to the future.

This book takes the reader through Woodward and Bernstein's efforts at uncovering the truth, internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering, and covert meetings with confidential sources. They tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the US Presidency was respected above all else.This book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was. Instead of printing first and asking questions later, Woodward and Bernstein, along with their editors, took painstaking efforts at checking, double checking, and even triple checking their sources and\", 'A lot of the reviews I have read here, both positive and negative, have noted Smith\\'s acerbic and sometimes hostile tone. In my own discussions on god, particularly when engaging Christians, I probably would not use SOME of the more harsh language found in the book.

They should be confronted by ANYONE who takes any position regarding religion or god.Perhaps the most revealing and important passage of the work comes at the beginning of the Chapter discussing the purported \"proofs\" for the existence of good posited by Christian Thealogians and laymen.

His portrait of Schary, a man I knew, bears no resemblance to that decent, fair minded, and gifted man. It is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of Schary.

The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic, virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate.

This is not to say, however, that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate.

The experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light, luminosity and color give life to an image, and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them.

I have also suggested that our local pre-school buys a copy for the adult library so that the poems can be shared with the children when relevant themes / moments arise.

I bought this book months ago. I read half of it, then moved from Seattle to Valdez, Alaska. All the while I was moving, I could not stop thinking about this book. As soon as my shipment arrived, I found the book ASAP and finished it. I have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books. I look at it this way: Spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - PLUS - you get to do this in the privacy of your home.

Pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic Iran got wary of meddling foreigners, starting with the hated Russians and Brits, in its domestic affairs (pp. 4, 41). Many Iranians have angry psychological scars, believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons (pp. 26, 71, 89, 99, 125, 128, 155-56, 161, 173-74, 242, 297, 389).

They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya, and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains. The first section of the book is about them, their customs, and the awful fear and darkness they lived in. Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin, and longing for release. The horror of their pain is graphic, and not suitable to be read to younger children. The second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale, his conversion, and his burden for those in darkness. He is drawn as a determined man, physically strong and fit, with firm convictions. The book goes on', 'Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment. Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man. During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going,', 'Add this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this, but one of the best in any language. Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse, Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer, Virgil, and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer, as are other elements, but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences, often with the principle verb at the end, being one of its mainstays. This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay', \"For someone totally unfamiliar with Authorware, I thought this book rather confusing.

He was the first poet to take all of American life as his subject. Ever the Romantic, Whitman was also the first poet to bring Romanticism into line with everyday reality.His narcissism can be annoying, but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power. Some of his short poems (\"A Noiseless Patient Spider\" and \"To a Locomotive in Winter\")are individually memorable. The longer poem \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed,\" indirectly about the Lincoln assassination, is brilliant.

One of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays, all around the central theme of the importance of character. While our culture often acts to create an \"end justifies the means\" behavioral set, never before has character been so important, or so difficult to really practice and live.The book begins with some essays from famous leaders; from Plato to George Washington, Winston Churchill to Machiavelli, and compares and', \"This book brings some of the items one read about in history classes to a more 'back channel' perspective.

The polarized atmosphere was palpably tense: while the U.S., the UK and Spain insisted that Iraq was not responding to inspections, France, Germany and Russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored. Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks, anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix.

The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage, the man who would become President of the United States.

It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them, trailing only the Bible.Atlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground, but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society; people who invent, design, build, manufacture, improve and manage.

Two figures left an imprint on the French art amidst the turbulent times of the late nineteenth century. Manet, whom history dubbed the father of Impressionism (although at the time art critics branded him untalented) and Meissonier, then the highest paid painters and now a figure obscured by history. How did time turn the tables on these two characters? Why is Meissonier forgotten, while the Manet's paintings sell with $20 million price tag? The answer is in this book. Mr. King's skillful examination of the art's progression from its realism to the appearance of impressionism in the latter part of 1800's makes for a delightful reading. He analyzes the art critics of the time, the leading political figures, the consequences of a war with Prussia, the French life and\", \"This book is more dated than THE SECRET GARDEN, but it's still a great story.

Sara's determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own. Some scenes (I don't want to spoil the surprise by describing them) are magical. A LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think.

The original edition of the 1930s by Sir Paul Harvey became a classic of its own and was intended by the author to be a handbook of information for readers of the Greek and Latin authors and of modern works that touched upon the classical world.

That's 47 books, for those who aren't keeping up with the math. Obviously, by now Parker knows what he's doing.

This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors).

Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.

Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).

The book is divided into three volumes focusing on Antisemitism, Imperialism, and Totalitarianism. The first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of Antisemitism. Arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of Antisemitism. For example, some historians have argued based on a \"scapegoat theory\" that the Jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world\\'s ills. Arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the Jews.

The fact that he himself, a descendent of Holocaust survivors, has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points: you cannot criticize the state of Israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti-Semite. Any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless UN resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism. By far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the Swiss banks; this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition. Finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion.

You may have also felt a spiritual presence while running, perhaps saying a prayer or working through personal problems while on the trail. In this extraordinary book, Joslin explores this mind/body connection and gives many different ways to experience the spiritual side of the sport. He shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal. The book is well thought-out and written with a great deal of humility and care. This is one that I will read again and again. It changed the way I approach running.

Lobdell has examined Tolkien's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives. One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction (Haggard, etc.) on Tolkien. Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre-Christian age. There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkien's own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the Shadow.

She really doesn\\'t fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority, gender feminist crowd. The one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth.

Here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be. Numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text. On the whole, it makes for compelling reading.

Killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes. After all, the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society.

Instead, he argues that even the \"truest\" brand of Western nationalism-that of England and France-came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale. His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today. This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position? Has he made the case for it? What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong? I will argue that the definition of the state, or the lack thereof, is key to answering all of the above questions. Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state, can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back', 'Tony Judt\\'s \"Postwar - A History of Europe Since 1945\" is the well researched material from a British conservative born 1948 in London and educated at Cambridge and Paris on political, social and economic developments in Europe following World War II.

As desire frames the relation between the subject and its other, Yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation. As a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen, the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest, but simultaneously displaced (62).

Here they come across prehistoric forests, a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs, and some ancient offshoots of man.

Maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture.', \"If you read one book on food ethics in your life, it should be this book.Singer and Mason's book is an excellently researched and foot-noted exploration of three different American diets, tracing these diets back to their sources and showing the many hidden affects that our food choices have on our environment, our neighbors, the animals that many of us eat, and ultimately ourselves. This book shows how these seemingly innocuous choices really do make a difference in our world, and then guides the reader towards resources which might help them make different choices, if they so choose.This book is not only full of an amazing depth and breadth of information on everything from organics, to local food, to intensive factory farms, to fair trade products, it also is immensely readable.

It's great in that you can skip around the book to the sections you NEED to read (or refresh yourself on). I keep it handy because I often refer to it. It is thorough in explaining various aspects of reading music, playing, etc. The humor interspersed makes it enjoyable to read rather than boring but the humor doesn't detract from the content and lesson.

Soon into the novel, the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World, a huge cyborg bear, who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds. Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam, and if they follow the beam, it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower, they just don't know how far away it is.As the three gunslingers start to follow the beam, we, the readers, are taken to our own world and reintroduced to\", \"Edward Gorey uses gothic illustrations to tell the tale of a strange creature who appears one day in a family's home.

Little wonder the media has awarded him the moniker \"The Surgeon\". In the course of their investigations, detectives Thomas Moore and Jane Rizzoli discover an earlier case with a virtually identical MO in Savannah in which the murderer, Andrew Capra, was ultimately killed by a stalwart would-be victim who fought back and shot him before he could finish the job! They are startled to discover that the surviving victim, Dr Catherine Cordell, is a noted cardiac surgeon currently practicing in a major Boston hospital, and beyond', \"Engrossing and amusing travelogue by world's crankiest traveler.Some people really hate Theroux, accusing him of snobbery, self importance, and bigotry. I can certainly see why some readers wouldn't be able to deal with his style and opinions, but I must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers' tolerance for the author's travel works. (If you can enjoy this one, you'll probably enjoy his other non-fiction works).I, for one, totally enjoyed hearing about grunge-y has-been towns, obnoxious holiday camps, and seedy hotels. To me, the book was a real page-turner, and he writes so vividly of scenery. I felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor, reminding us travelers that it's helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times.

This cookbook is the one I use over and over again. I have cooked almost every recipe in the book, more than once, which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook.The beauty of it is that is is simple -- most ingredients are things you would have on-hand.

The remit of the Dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss. The text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science. In this respect it would have been a difficult book to author, readers having come from one discipline or the other.

However, the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100% happy should read Runaway Jury. However, like The Firm (another great book) that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble, this book has a very realistic ending that you didn't expect. This was my favorite Grisham book, followed by The Firm, Runaway Jury, and Pelican Brief. I found the Broker to be too much of an Italian lesson, the Brethern simplistic, and The Street Lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people - with very little story holding it together.

Although it\\'s about Copernicus\\' book \"De Revolutionibus\", very little astronomy is discussed. There is also very little about Copernicus himself. The main theme of the book is finding as many still-existing copies of Copernicus\\' book as possible, and describing each one in detail - the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so-called \"census\" of that ancient book, i.e., a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world.

As -guidelines- with notions about starting points and signposts along the way, however, these are very useful. Neil's six-step Treatment Outline seems a bit oddly ordered, and I wasn't able to find a rationale for determining diagnosis in the final step (when you have to lay one on the client's payment guarantor at the outset).

She speaks about the rights of the First Amendment pertaining to free speech, and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed. The book is informative and thought- provoking. Ravitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and cannot be said in certain literature for education. She goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used. This list is ridiculous and completely irrational. Due to left and right wing intervention, almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements.

Delighted at her good fortune, Cece packs up herself and her two friends, Lael and Bridget, a boatload of vintage clothes (which she collects, though she told', \"I consider myself an optimist and insightful person, but somehow managed to miss many of Postrel's insights. She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought. She does keep that hope in check, though, by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat, instead of the blessing that it is. She thoroughly destroys the notion that 'there is nothing new under that sun'. While the universe, therefore our earth, is necessarily finite, we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in.

One interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government-sponsored churches, a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation.

While not an authentic artifact, it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of America's most successful and controversial social-religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. This reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of Joseph Smith (Author and Proprietor) to the pen(s) of his various scribes. When the book is placed in it's historical context, the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current LDS Church as well as Smith's answers for many of the religious\", 'If you wish to improve the Quality of your software development, this book is worth reading, studying, and questioning.

Many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as Harper's and The New Yorker--so, readers should know what they're getting into. I read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of Franzen as a corporeal human being, and not just some exalted author of an award-winning novel. Overall, I liked most of the essays appearing in this collection. From the promising opener, in which Franzen poignantly recounts his father's slow descension into quietus from Alzheimer's, we progress to a quasi-portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in America, before Ashcroft and the Patriot Act invaded the American lexicon.

The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing, but the plot was, at times, predictable. The setting was well-drawn, but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. The clincher, though, is that I'm not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character. I believe that this is her first story, so I don't want to make a snap judgement, but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple. That would be expecting a lot, I know, but frankly she isn't even as engaging as, say, Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael, and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.As I said, the jury is still out for\", \"Exposure to Harv Eker's Millionaire Mind Intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago.

First off: the style is simple and direct - no big words and no long sentences. But this is by no means to imply that it is unsophisticated. As the product of a 19-20 year old mind, it impresses. It reads very much like a modern novel. This is the kind of novel you wish you could have written yourself - at any age, let alone 19 or 20. As such, it is remarkable.Secondly: the subject matter is disturbing yet something that must be taught.

The big problem is that, as Henry Ford once said \"History is bunk\". With Joseph Smith and the history of the Mormon church, there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many, an ingenious charlatan. There are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide. Hence, using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of Joseph Smith can be a very frustrating (and sometimes expensive) exercise. The Church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony, but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony.

While some philosophers and others had in the past, argued for the necessity of being kind to animals (Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism), Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals. Singer's primary argument, and a very interesting one, is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals, particularly in the structures of our vital organs, nervous systems and brains.

These attitudes may have been important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level.They too may have had certain effect on overall U.S. policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into Auschwitz. There were also efforts to influence negatively American attitudes towards the emerging Jewish state in Israel. This is in a way a sad and yet important book to read.

Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono, who likened Goldman\\'s book to \"being punched in the face.\" Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldman\\'s book. Some of Lennon\\'s fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty. Now, however, the dust has settled, and _The Lives of John Lennon_ holds up beautifully. Each contention of Goldman\\'s which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands. Remember the ridiculous panic over Goldman\\'s portrait of Lennon as a heavy drug user? That drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who', 'Many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports.

The book's cover gives you an idea of what they look like.

I've never had a photo published in the Engagement book, but I've probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office.

Instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters. The reason: this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter.

When Deborah's first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash, short-on-time lifestyle.

This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn\\'t really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850. The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in \"cowboy\" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways. The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth.

Among all low cost editions of the whole Bible (Protestant canon), this one is outstanding in three respects:1) it has the most extensive annotations (footnotes, introductions and outlines for each book of the Bible, and study helps) of any. They are not as extensive as many full-fledged study Bibles, of course, but it is a fraction of the price.2) these annotations appear to have been designed to be solely descriptive, not reflecting any particular theological or scholarly bias. Thus, this edition can be used by persons with quite a wide range of theological orientations. 3) it has the largest print size.

Not being an easy read, it takes some time to get through. The main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context. This is quite an achievement, considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics.Watson tends to cover science the best, and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science, including the theories of relativity, quantum mechanics, scientific cosmology, evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene.

For a beginner like myself, who loved chocolate but hadn't progressed much beyond Hershey's with Almonds when I read the book, _The New Taste of Chocolate_ was very educational.

The theme is vampire - the creatures that feed by night on their human cattle. But what if the night goes on and on?Good suspense, good characters and development, and an artistic style that carries the mood. It's a nightmarish visual style and a limited palette (black, white, and blood red), but it works.

That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition.

Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged.

Lenin pointed out that \"The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914)\". He wanted to correct that oversight, and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book. \"The State and revolution\" is a very short book, well structured and not difficult to read at all. Initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters, but Lenin didn\\'t conclude the seventh, due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution. In the postscript to the first edition he explains that, saying that due to the reasons already', 'My kids and I love this book. There were so many cute ideas, several parties worth.

The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian, I particlularly liked this historical information.

It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by Rand. They approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand's work in the larger history of esthetic theory. They demolish abstract art, and devote considerable energy to discussing Rand's definition of art. They even propose their own individual alternatives! If anything shows independence, it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work! Remarkable! The world of Rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship. That is clear just by reading one of the reviews\", '&quot;Good Sports&quot; is a book which helps girls to be the &quot;best athlete you can be.&quot; It catagorizes players, parents, and other important people into real-life situations. It has quizes, quotes from other athletes, and memory pages. Also, it offers a lot of web sites and other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. More importantly, this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is all about. One of my favorite parts in the book says: &quot;Sometimes heart is the strongest muscle.&quot; This book also tells girls how to take good care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. It includes the food pyramid and what one serving is. &quot;Good Sports&quot; involves &quot;Power Drills&quot; and advice from other girls.

MUD Game Programming lived up to all of my expectations, and indeed surpassed them.The author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and, equally important, making them interesting. Reading MUD Game Programming is like having a friendly, cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade. Instead of just telling you what to do, he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a MUD server, enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project, which might not be the same.

The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian, they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly.

Unlike them, but not unlike a master performer, Palmer is able to strike a balance between technique, feeling, and authenticity: He is historically and musically adept without denying the Blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance.

It is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism; the interaction between the \"new\" domestic and international values, based on aggression; and the other causes involved in the rise (and fall) of the III Reich.

Chain-smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) makes the only decisive (and dishonest) action of his life, and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several, mostly not-so-innocent, bystanders. In \"The Man Who Wasn\\'t There,\" the phrase \"decisive action\" is an oxymoron; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance.

The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris.

Despite personal tragedies, and through two World Wars, Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers' academy, including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage, Irish accent intact all the way.

The hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch. This film is an example of Disney animation at its classic best.

I read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it, and while most critics kind of liked it, there were a few grumbles. However, I thought the film was excellent, and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans.

We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment. But he is pounced upon by the baker.

However, if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film, you are going to be disappointed.

I saw it when it first came out and ten years later it's still just as funny. Basic plot: Ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he's ALONE on New Year's night. Anyone who's had a bad night/day on the job can relate to Ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations. From the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion, to a gangster's bratty kids, a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken Hollywood people who want to make Ted part of their hazardous (and very gross) bet.

Fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the DVDs will find this set a great one to have.\"Jurassic Park\" introduced us to digital dinosaurs and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology. This movie advanced horror and monster movies in a method similar to the way \"Alien\" advanced science fiction movies. \"Jurassic Park\" immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged. Stephen Spielberg effectively combined in-your-face terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of life-like creatures dinosaurs.\"The Lost World\" unfortunately did not measure up to \"Jurassic Park.\" Many of the characters were unbelievable', 'I loved Ben Vereen in the show.

Their show is not BETTER, it is of equal and noteworthy standing. Monty Python is history that will never been changed. They have gone on to do many other creative things. Bob Odenkirk is doing Miller Lite commercials and I hope he does something like David has with his new appearance in Arrested Development.

Scenes of so much pain and death, the very walls soaking up the agony through the years, they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there. The hospital in \"Infection\" (\"Kansen\") is in particularly bad shape. Losing money, unable to keep staff, the doctors and nurses working there are under-qualified and desperate. Into this unstable environment comes a strange patient, with a black, infectious rash. Slowly, the rash spreads, revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human\\'s body, slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation.

The film seemed to say too much and show too little. Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work, something clicked. The long duration of the shot and the narrator's continued breakdown of the man's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives, that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds, and that we are powerless to silence it.That floored me, and for the rest of the film, I remained\", 'This is a great film that preceded the onset of the \"JLo.\" \"Out of Sight\" is a great showcase for Jennifer Lopez\\'s talent as an actress.

She has a chance encounter with charming, compulsive bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney). Their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping of Sisco in her OWN car. It is no surprise that sparks fly.....however, this doesn\\'t downplay the complexities of their star-crossed encounter. Some of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks, incorporating trick camera work and voice overs.

It is amazing. I'm very happy to finally find a complete version of the stage show on DVD. Rachel York does a top-notch performance in the leading role. The rest of the cast is up to par. There have been other reviews that say the music is dated, or other such nonsense, but do not pay heed to them. Premiered in 1948, the musical is based on The Taming of the Shrew (Shakespeare), and the music and lyrics are done by Cole Porter. Sometimes referred to as his masterpiece (which I agree with), the production never drags or disappoints. The lyrics are extremely witty (a trademark of Porter).

Luckily, co-writer, director, and actor Nanni Moretti avoids all the usual clich\\x1as in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film. The Son's Room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them.

Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series.

Signs is the story of hope lost, faith put aside because of intense pain and grief, and how one man's relationship with God affects the lives of those around him.

What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now. In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now. Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development. It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.

Added to their performances are footage from many periods of Mr. Cohen's life, interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well.

It's up to a reporter woman named Rachel to figure everything out. She's the main character of the film, along with her son.As I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain.

Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.

I wish some filmmaker (Curtis would be great!) would do a REMAKE of this entire project -- making it into a 4 hour feature movie -- tightening up the script entirely (apologies to Mr. Wouk who wrote the teleplay) -- mostly keep in the historical scenes--but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea-- and do away with some of the long, soap opera dialogue\", 'As with vol 1, I bought this for my wife, and she is thrilled with it', 'Of course the movie deserves 4 stars, however I wish I could say the same for the DVD.

The film examines the political climate in 1970s America, and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary SLA. Political rhetoric aside, the SLA careened through California on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks. But more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the SLA, filmmaker Michael Stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment.

Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama.

However, there are times when I need her to be more calm like when I change a diaper, try feeding new foods, and right before and after naps. These movies have been lifesavers to me.

Paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871, and as a result, homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail. Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, a German Jewish doctor, and a pioneer in the study of Human Sexuality, formed the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee with the goal of repealing Paragraph 175. In Weimar Germany of the 1920s, an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals, and Berlin became a \"homosexual Eden.\" But once the Nazis took power, they enforced anti-gays laws with a vengeance. According to historian Klaus Muller, in Nazi Germany 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality, and approximately 10,000-15,000 were sent to concentration camps. Of that number, less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made.

And I don't\", 'This is a very emotional film. It induces emotion in the viewer, and for that I give it five stars. I\\'m more interested in constructive criticism than in praise, so even though I think it is an excellent film, I will just focus on what I think is wrong with it.One problem is that Blanche DuBois is simply too pretty for the role. We don\\'t understand, on a gut level, why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting. The script makes it clear that she is supposed to look \"old\", and yet she doesn\\'t. That\\'s a fault of the film. It makes her final passionate scene with Karl Malden incomprehensible. He holds her up to the light, she looks very pretty, and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light.', \"I first saw this movie in high school in the theater. I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now. So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence.I understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing, given that she only appears in a very few scenes. Well, that's the way of the world - it's marketing right or wrong, and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known. It's not right, but that's Hollywood. I mean, better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all, yes?And you've got to admit, it was quite a\", \"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times. I've always like Tom Cruise and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. But the real star is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader-what perfect casting! And Koyuki as the Samurai widow was just plain gorgeous. The HD DVD transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better. Highly recommended\", 'I think this is a beautiful story about a man, who wanted to change his country. He was not looking for his lost money, he wanted a new Hungary. The story about a great man, love through peace, war and blood. A great story from the hungarian history.

But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one. We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far, the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.One more thing: in order to the', 'I saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre.

The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you\\'ll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a \"coming of age\" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours', 'A friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it. Wow! Our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over. We used the DVD along with us talking about numbers and she was doing great. Before pre-school started she was able to add and subtract numbers between 0 - 10.', 'The stellar performances of Jason Alexander (Buzz) and John Glover (James/John) make this movie, providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film. The Swan Lake scene, while funny, is probably the most sad, as each character explains how he will pass on. Yet the most interesting character to me is Gregory, as he is the glue that holds this group of men together, generously offering his Victorian house for holiday vacations. It is he who starts the film with his narration, welcoming the viewer in as if we are a visitor to his home as well, and having the final narration during the Swan Lake scene. He is caretaker to his friends in life and in death, and the central character that the six others revolve around; it is befitting that he will be the last', \"This movie is a great movie to add to your DVD collection. Especially if you are a mob fan. This movie is about corruption within the mob, about betrayal, about death and dying. It starts off with someone trying to whack the don, and the family trying to find out who it is and why. I'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story. Just watch it. Mario Puzo's The Last Don (1997) was great too\", 'I don\\'t own this series, but I watch it on PBS. It\\'s great. They cover a limited number of words per episode, and I\\'m grateful; it can get a little overwhelming. My 2 1/2 year old daughter only does a few signs, but she\\'s able to decipher anything I sign to her. I know \"Mama\", \"Hungry\", \"Want,\" \"Cookie\"... For now that will have to do for \"Mama is hungry, she wants a cookie.\" You\\'ll catch other words from the songs. Go to the Signing Time website. They have sample videos, and lyrics, you\\'ll get the idea. A little at a time is good enough for me. Expert proficiency is not my expectation here. Five Stars', 'I love this series and plan to buy more. It is well done. The signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting, or watch the whole dvd. The word is first shown, then a mom shows the sign, then kids demonstrate (including some use of the actual object, if appropriate). My child and I have both picked up signs quickly from this DVD', '\"The Bad Sleep Well\" is a forgotten gem from one of Japan\\'s great masters, Akira Kurosawa. His other two Shakespeare adaptations, \"Throne of Blood\" (Macbeth) and \"Ran\" (King Lear), are much more famous and well-regarded, justifiably so if you have seen them (\"Ran\" is particular is my favorite of all Kurosawa films). However, this sharp and caustic adaptation of Hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition. It may be the most bleak subject matter that Kurosawa ever tackled - the corruption in the highest levels of government in post-war Japan.The film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates Kurosawa\\'s great skill as a director. We (and the camera) are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage; the bride is lame and the daughter of Iwabuchi, the head', '\"The Thomas Crown Affair\" gets better everytime I watch it. I spot something I missed. Hear music which I heard but never listened to and see how it relates to the movie. Actually hearing the \"Windmills of my Mind\". This is an unbelievably good movie, although I prefer the original\\'s ending', \"Gosh. The other reviewer, who seems to me, only watched the first four episodes of this series and judged the title soley on that. Oh, and on the DVD covers.

I'm not going to get into details on this anime, for good reviews check out www.themanime.org, I'm just saying I liked it, and if you're paitient, and like a good mystery, I hope you find this series just as enjoyable as i do.\", 'I ordered this guide so that I could understand all of the options and functions available on my new Nikon D200.

I highly reccommend it', \"Jude is a very powerful film. It is also very disturbing, but it is absolutely a must see. This is an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's last novel, the film isn't exactly like the novel, but if you can ignore that then you'll find that this is quite a terrific film. Just don't expect exactly what you got from the novel. Over all I give it four stars.\", 'I waited years for this movie to be released in the United States. As far as I was concerned, it wasn\\'t about the acting, as much as it was about the \"feeling\" the actors wanted to portray, in which they, profoundly, accomplished. I would recommend this movie to anyone who can reach that one step deeper into the minds of creativity and passion, and appreciate the struggles of rising above and beyond the pain of broken dreams', 'Murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle. Which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a \"regular Don Juan\" to his neighbor Winston, a family man.Murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago, searching for a possible son, whose existence is unclear, and who may just be a hoax. The visits are all shocking in different ways. All women live in similar locations, though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth. All encounters are odd, the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident. She was number 5 in the list of \"suspects\" for the mother of the phantom son.Don\\'t watch this film if you need', 'This is one of my favorite movies and i find it unfortunate that not too many people know about it. I think it is important for people to know this story. Everyone should watch this movie simply because it is fantastic', '\"The Medium\" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005. I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in. However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating. Patricia Arquette who was in \"Ed Wood\" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois. Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in \"Meet Joe Black\" and plays her husband Joe is riveting. They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison\\'s psychic ability. I found', \"I was happy to see a 'romantic comedy' that didn't line up with every other formula picture in the genre. Really fun stuff and some solid acting\", \"This video is amazing!

These videos have been proven to increase a child's IQ, so I don't feel [too] guilty about letting him watch.\", 'While I\\'ve always loved Blade Runner, the so-called \"Theatrical Cut\" was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation. Harrison Ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped. But Hollywood, in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience\\'s intelligence and artistic sensitivity, stuck with it anyway, on the assumption that we needed to be spoon-fed with sophomoric incompetence.Equally stupid, though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted, was the inappropriate sappy ending, which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well. It didn\\'t even make any sense: the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars. But Hollywood, with characteristic cowardice, trembled in fear at the thought of', \"This was an excellent experience. My movies arrived very promptly and I have had the pleasure of watching them numerous times. Everything went well; the DVD's were still in their original wrapping and excellent condition! I will definitely order from here again\", 'I really like this video because of its time (30 minutes regular with 10 min bonus segment = 40 min total) and I like the instructor. Janice is really good, calm, cues well, doesnt talk a lot, and is not overly inspiring. She clearly points out the person who will be doing alternative/low impact moves and then continues on. There is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn - no hard choreography either. I use this w/ a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one I enjoy to return to.There are 3 segments each focusing on a different section: core, upper and lower body. The bonus segment is a high impact/faster segment combining all elements. Worth the time', 'An amazing film! Not only is it a fantastic adventure, but the story is well laid out. Just the right amount of special effects, great music and good actors. When seeing this movie at the theater I was not too excited, but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is. Not nearly as gory as Gladiator, but is similar in style. 5 out of 5', \"I have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding Robert Kennedy, and I've got to say that this is, by far, one of the best pieces of work I've yet to see. The movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience's attention, allows for us to actually *feel* what Robert Kennedy is feeling, to sense the tension during chaotic times, and most importantly, to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for America.This movie is extremely well-balanced, provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of Robert Kennedy, and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from Kennedy's life. If you are looking to pick one movie on Robert Kennedy - this is it. This is THE one you want\", \"I just finished watching most of it, and it's not too bad. The thing that most struck me is it doesn't take very long to see which were the eras for Superman that had the most influence on Bryan Singer. He spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get Superman started, then we're quickly through the comics and the Kirk Alyn eras, then it slows down for a long retrospective of the George Reeves years, both in Superman and the Mole Men and The Adventures of Superman, then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the 50s, 60s and 70s, then stops again for a lengthy study of Superman: the Movie, then briefly about Superman II, Superman III, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and Superboy,\", 'Saw the names Kathy Bates, Barry Manilow and Julie Andrews, so had to give it a view.

Best lines in a film ever as well, \"Julie Andrews is in the cockpit.\"\"Thank god.\"That alone has enriched my life beyond measure', 'Only the timidity of the studios could explain how this movie landed on the shelves without even a mention - It\\'s up to word of mouth to save it. And it\\'s certainly worth saving. Nobody does the \"awakening matron\" like Kathy Bates (see \"Fried Green Tomatoes\"), and her Grace Beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice. She needs it. Her daughter-in-law (Meredith Eaton) is an acid-tongued dwarf with no inhibitions, and Dan Ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the Johnstown flood.

This DVD has everything: meditation, relaxation, mantras, stretching, wonderful music, beautifully narrated and professionally presented.

Working at Initech Corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston). Besides having a job he hates, he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is. Then there is his boss Lumbergh--an arrogant jerk. Life for Peter Gibbons is just one boring day after another. That is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion [and demands] of his then girlfriend.While undergoing hypnotic suggestion, the psychologist dies of a heart-attack.

And his boss Lumbergh gets a', '(3.5/5 stars) Listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly, ashen-faced with blank stares; where is the horror in that? Sounds like a typical Sunday afternoon at the mall to me. In fact, Dawn of the Dead (1978) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film. More or less picking up where \"Night of the Living Dead\" left off, zombies are on the hunt for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don\\'t bring', 'Kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular \"Bloodsport\" and like Bloodsport, Kickboxer is no doubt a \"Van Damme classic\". There are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences, however the acting suffers - worse than Bloodsport in that department. As for the plot - revenge - go figure. But we don\\'t need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie. Hey, it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action. Fortunately, Kickboxer delivers it well. The movie begins with a couple of good fights right away. About 1/2 of the movie is training sequences, but many are enjoyable to watch. The final fight is between the villain, Tong Po (played by Michel Qissi) and Kurt Sloane', \"I have trouble saying how much I enjoyed this movie. The plot was well worn, but it didn't feel staid or plodding. Visually, the movie is simply stunning. Absolutely some of the best visuals I have seen in years. The Jim Henson company outdid themselves this time\", 'Maybe you\\'ve heard that \"it\\'s all been done before.\" Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie. It really is something new.McKean has worked for years in the comic industry, defining a visual style that works at a visceral level. The style has many ways to look, depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy. Some times McKean\\'s work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone, other times it\\'s a pen-scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken. Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience. I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well, I was wrong. This movie\\'s imagery defies easy description. I can only invite you to see it for yourself, and to experience a movie that is truly like no other.', 'I\\'m another of those who saw this at Sundance, and all the things I enjoy about Gaiman and McKean\\'s graphic novels were on display: the quiet humor, the intelligence, the delightful weirdness, the astounding visual vocabulary. Except that in this case, the words are spoken by good actors, and all those visuals get up off their feet and move.It\\'s hard to describe the impact of watching a McKean painting move and talk. There might be those who quibble about the movie looking too \"animated,\" but of course that\\'s exactly the point: to create a world and make it dance. The end result, visually at least, is like nothing you\\'ve ever seen before, and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone.Some of the people I talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was', 'I loved this movie.

His performance is so over the top he would have qualified for the pole vault in the Sydney Olympics merely by forwarding a copy of this DVD to the judges. Dakota Fanning is as precious as ever and I hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years (Todd Bridges, Jill Whelan, Eve Plumb).I was not put off by all the commercial tie-ins and know that making a movie has a lot of expenses.\", \"I Am Sam is superb to the core. Excellent performances across the board, and an emotionally involving story. Sean Penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged. This is a veritable tour de force for him. But not to be upstaged is Dakota Fanning, who plays opposite of Penn and is named Lucy Diamond after the hit Beatles song. Sean Penn's character has to fight for custody of Lucy, and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, for free. She helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor. All in all, a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness. One of my favorites\", 'This, as you may have already read, was a very intimate little show made to promote Morning View. The live footage is as good as it gets, and the sound is flawless to boot. This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet.

What I like about this show is that Keifer Sutherlands character Jack Bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against C.T.U or the President.

Intelligent and resourceful, they had hooked up to free electricity and had working TV's and stoves.What makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary.

If you have seen the remake with Michael Douglas, pretend you haven't and watch the way it SHOULD be done. If you've seen neither version of the film, get this one and get ready for anything. This is above all a classically sarcastic farce between two misfits who have amazing chemistry together. Both Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are marvelous craftsmen, and their combination of silliness and genuine rolicking humor is blended in an almost non-stop pace from beginning to end.

His books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues, but practical issues of the greatest moment. There is a great line in Kierkegaard, in the preface to THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH, where he writes: \"Everything essentially Christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed; even if only medical experts understand it, it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person.\" What gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them, as he struggled to live out the implications of Christianity at a time when it was especially challenging', 'Bonhoeffer was a very informative, very interesting video.

In the film, his daughter dies in childhood, and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits Venice.Another reviewer here called the film \"ambient\"; I would add the word \"poised.\" The camera lingers on scenes for many minutes; observations occur in planes of depth.

Not only does he nail down the African accent, but he portray's Biko's renown concern and persistence.This movie was awesome for the first hour. I could not take my eyes off it! As the inevitable came around this point, the movie turns to Kevin Kline's character who's trying to escape South Africa and spread Biko's story and message.

You are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece ( when Liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character), you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others.

Now in his mid-twenties, and musically out of almost nowhere, Li is already a full fledged musician.

Benigni plays wonderfully off Lurie and Waits, culminating in a hilarious version of &quot;I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice scream.&quot; Eventually, they find the light at the end of a tunnel, only to have to escape through a swamp.

Naturally, everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour. Midway through the movie, out of nowhere, one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission. It is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief, confusing, and brutal.

It covers Michaels disco years through the 1990s. \"Beat it\" and \"Billie Jean\" are timeless videos and show you Michael Jackson at his creative zenith. This dvd also includes the full length videos of \"Bad\" and \"Thriller\" Lets not forget \"Remember the time\" with its amazing dance moves and catchy rythem. This dvd compilation makes you see why Michael Jackson will always be the king of pop. I like this dvd out of all of Michael Jacksons dvd releases. \"Dont stop till you get enough\" and \"Rock with you\" may be simple videos but I watch both videos and see an innocence in Michael before the Thriller phenomenon.

Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range. Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality. In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.

It successfully shows that all of the criticisms against Wal-Mart are outright lies, half-truths, distortions of facts, or just plain ideological hatred for a successful business. It shows what the employees go through while on the job and off the job. It also shows how Wal-Mart has actually increased America\\'s standard-of-living by allowing the poorest of us to purchase our daily necessities at the lowest price possible and the least-skilled amongst us able to attain high-quality health benefits and a decent wage.Wal-Mart is not a perfect business, and it never will be.

The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Front DVD; it has more core work, more one-leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells. The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Backside DVD; it has more core work, harder exercises and additional power moves.

Nothing was off limits... the Queen Mother, Death, hopscotch, speed archeology, toasters, and Achilles. It is all here!Take special note of the set... very minimalist.

Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life.

It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from \"Ishmael\" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - \"takers\" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don\\'t know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it.

While many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless, dreamy structure, I found it boring and phantasmagorical. It is simply Fellini's version of Rome and not Rome, the Eternal City itself. To risk sounding negative, I shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970's Rome - the scenes in which the hippies and American tourists invade the city, the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off (though saying some pretty vulgar things) and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old Roman Patricians fade into oblivion.

The positives of this movie are, it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love, one that doesn\\'t turn out in the same way other movies portray.

(Not Paliestine! The Romans named the region Palestine after the war against the Jews in 70CE). The fact that one man (Constantine) sought a single authoritive finality was a political move, not an act or miracle of \"God.\" Authority of apostles is more Christian myth and power assertion, not historical proof of the varacity of the Bible and Christian claims.

Irish Catholic McCarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed \"Going My Way\" and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the Catholic world inhabited by Father O\\'Malley.Bing Crosby had garnered a Best Actor Oscar for \"Going My Way\" and McCarey secured the services of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to play Sister Benedict, the Mother Superior of St. Mary\\'s School.

The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made.SEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons. It's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting. The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show.

In the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people. In the Japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help. anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves Asian horror and likes a good plot and movie!! go\", 'This film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it. The plot is not very intriguing, and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life, so it lacks this sense of reality. A dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer, which is exactly the point of this movie. However, this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end, and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute. Elijah Wood is stunning, only due to his efforts can the film get some believability. Caulkin is perfect in this role too, portraying the bad boy, I have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor.

The problem is that it isn\\'t clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary. As a documentary about the reenactment, this is a fine collection of footage, interspersed with some (thankfully) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides. (Actually, I thought the actor portraying Longstreet did a fine job -- the others were less convincing.) As a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle. As a reenactor, I found it interesting watching the various units on the field.

Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.

It is about this character named Adrian Monk (played by Tony Shalhoub, \"Wings\"), who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias. He is also incredibly intelligent; he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly, provided that he has all the right clues. The most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when Monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words, which, for some of the most intense cases, will really shock the audience: \"I\\'ve solved the case.\" However, for some reason, the best part always seems to be when he says, \"Here\\'s what happened.\"When it comes to the scenes involving murder cases, it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very, very brutal.

I was paying attention so I knew what the set up was, both inside and out of the precinct, as we went along. But being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in James DeMonaco\\'s script (I made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters I was sure would survive all the bullets and I was half-right, which is a polite way of saying I was half-wrong).

That was something that really added to the storyline. They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal, too.

Oh, and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time, which made it better when those bad things happened to them. A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers.

Director John Ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences. For sure the film does contain a number of Western archetypes(the gambler, the prostitute with a heart of gold, etc.) but they transcend the stereotypes. \"Stagecoach\" is also significant as the film that broke John Wayne to mainstream audiences. Wayne\\'s entrance as the Ringo Kid is the stuff of legends. There is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated Claire Trevor as the social pariah, Dallas, and Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone, for which he won an Oscar.

Jackie Chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action-packed foil to 'Fillius Fogg' played with brilliant English reserve & self-deprecating humor by 'Steve Coogan'.

He eventually is court-martialed en route, and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the Enterprise's visit to Talos IV 13 years prior.

But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film. These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.

Overall, I highly recommend this collection for even the casual filmgoer who is looking for that unique film experience\", 'Great acting and development in the multi-linear plot movie. Very heavy movie however, that may be out of some people\\'s \"reach\" as to understanding and appreciation. Strisand and Nolte were both brilliant', 'The tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer. For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England.Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury:U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down.British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war.Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store', \"This documentary is very concise, and very straight forward. It does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir. It features interviews with some very credible sources, all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic. I really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together. This documentary makes a great point and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics\", \"One of the best movies I have seen!!! The subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your 'normal' boundaries. After watching this movie, you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does.In terms of film quality, it is also one of the best I have seen. The actors are tremendous, the characters are so accurately portrayed that you actually feel the pain of each one of them. Of course, Ludovic's innocence is rendered beautifully, but the changes that the mother goes through are very emotionally charged (maybe because I am a mother myself???). She seems at first to be the most understanding of all when it comes to her son's differences, then goes\", \"Monty Python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever.

It's about Arthur and his knights looking for the Holy Grail. This movie will make you laugh insanely. Funny moments include The Killer Rabbit, The Knights Who Say Ni, and The Black Knight.THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSENThis movie is not a Monty Python film but was made by Terry Gilliam and co-stars Eric Idle, both of whom are former Pythons.A must have for any Monty Python fan.This set\", 'We have both of these, although we purchased them seperately. Save yourself the time and money and just get them together. The Magical Halloween Adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides, pumpkin patches, carving pumpkins and making cider. There is a cute songs about monsters not being scary. The Elmo Says Boo! one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has Elmo all over it. We have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that. In my opinion, they are not scary. Also, we watch them year round...especially the Elmo one. She will pull it out and ask for it...who knew you could have Halloween in July??', 'I spent ten years working various scenes at the Trinity Church Hellhouse. Yes, it is a bit campy, and yes, it is often over the top, but I can say that the people are well intentioned, just a bit off target. I attended Trinity Church from birth until I was 22 years old. I do not attend their anymore because of the close-minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary. I stopped doing HellHouse when they added the decision room my last year. I just felt it was an un-biblical scare tactic. I now feel that way about the entire operation. The worst feeling I get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves. I know because I was once one of them. I have found that a growing number of', \"This is a movie you'll want to watch over again--a number of times for a number of reasons. For one, you'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go-round (perhaps the second and third go-round, too, and even beyond). As the legend goes, with the exception of a few brief, well-timed breathers, director Howard Hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film's sleek 92 minutes, with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once.I agree with the Amazon review: you'll also want to give the movie at least one look devoted exclusively to Cary Grant's performance as master-manipulator news chief Walter Burns. One can only marvel at his hair-trigger, incendiary reactions to each situational development. The big scoop involves the politically-driven gallows sentence\", \"I don't usually like romance films, but 2046 is brilliant! A mind trip AND sensual candy!If you have a short attention span, you will not appreciate this work of art. But if the first half draws you in, the second half will BLOW YOUR MIND!Wong Kar Wai sets up analogies between the relationships of each character. By comparing characters in this way, we are given infinite perspectives on the characters and their emotions.This is genius!This is art!Full of colorful symbolism\", \"i have ever seen.What to say for this film.Great acting,great story and great music.Don't hesitate go get it.This will be one of the gems in your movie collection.And please guys when you come to movies like this masterpiece don't give them a 3 star rate.Not beacuse it didn't have many extras or something like this.The movie is that counts\", 'I watched this movie in health class during a unit on ageing. The movies was very touching, and turned the whole class to tears.

If that did not happen, buy the Season 3 dvd's because Brendan Small is just immensely funny and enjoyable. The Renaissance Fair episode is unbelievable\", 'There were loads of Swords & Sorcery films coming out in the 80\\'s, most of them low budget garbage. But this was actually one of the better films. It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable. Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant. Pretty standard stuff. But it\\'s exectuted well. The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard\\'s Conan Story \"The Hour of the Dragon\" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer. In the Conan story the sorcerer\\'s name was Zaltotun. In this movie, the name is Xusia. Mere coincidence? I think not. But Xusia is played well be', \"The technical quality of the DVD is excellent. My interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend's wall of Charlie Chaplin and an actor. The actor, Hugh Sasson, was the Uncle of my friend's mother. He appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked. The photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet. We set the photo on the TV and stepped through this scene on the DVD one frame at a time. It gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time.Additionally, the story of the production difficulties found on disk 2 are fascinating\", 'First, off, if it has Pauly Shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny. In this comedy, Pauly Shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money, little does he know when he picks their area of expertise, water clarifacation, that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty. Watch this movie', '\"Mighty Quinn\" features a young sexy Denzel Washington (Xavier Quinn) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island. There\\'s a shadowy plot involving $10,000 bills, a guerilla movement and guns, but the movie focuses more on Quinn\\'s conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder, and Quinn\\'s own discomfort from having \"made good\" but ending up caught between two worlds, white and black. He\\'s also caught between the islanders\\' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation. This film is full of sexy island women, colorful reggae music, and real world dilemmas of race and identity. No matter that we couldn\\'t quite figure out if the plot hung together. A winner', \"... then this would be a really serious detective. As it's executed now, it's a superbly relaxed copper-gets-the-villain with serious undertones.

It's actually real funny and entertaining.\", \"This animation is as hilarious as when it was first aired, maybe even more so as the careers of some of those who sat on the good doctor's couch have blossomed eg David Cross, who you may remember from such shows as Arrested Development. Even Ray Romano is funny. The animation is great, especially the New York City scenes. Ben Katz is a scene stealer.

I did go to his memorial service... a little late, I admit. But this DVD gives so much insight into the realm of the synth. There\\'s a fair amount of footage from the 50th anniversary event \"Moogfest\" at BB King\\'s in NYC, in May of 2004. I attended that show, and was just one table from the stage, right in front of Keith Emerson and his monster-moog. There is also some segments of Bob and Rick Wakeman back stage (It was Rick Wakeman\\'s birthday).Anyway- good stuff... I would buy it if I were you. I AM', 'I first saw \"Dragonslayer\" when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981. It was the first VHS movie I ever purchased. It\\'s very well made, an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about. It still holds up. Caitlin Clarke\\'s performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job. I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter. I learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004. \"Dragonslayer\" has action, humor, humanity, political irony. And if none of those matter to you: it\\'s just plain fun', 'Good movie with a unique storyline. Special effects were verygood for the time of filming', \"Other People's Money is a wonderful movie, full of smart dialogue, good music, and a terrific Danny DeVito performance. DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch. Very good stuff there. The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie. This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on. Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck\", 'I bought a balance ball kit from another location, but wanted a more complete workout than the sampler that came with the kit.

Though there are still some diferences between the Japanese version and what is in the uncut version. I wouldn't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core Naruto fan. The bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs\", 'The great thing about the Naruto series is it has an involved, ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously. The episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen. It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.My small gripes are that for some reason Naruto has the catch phrase of \"Believe it!\", and it gets dropped into places that it doesn\\'t make any sense, but it\\'s a small problem.Also the extras you get are really fun and high quality. This is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike', 'What do you know about being underground? Get this if you really suck at djing', '\"I Wake Up Screaming\" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of \"noir\" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called \"mystery lighting\"- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate. When model', 'First-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu\\'s 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same souffl�-light rom-com territory as Ol Parker\\'s half-hearted \"Imagine Me and You\" and Ian Iqbal Rashid\\'s overly cute \"A Touch of Pink\". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.The plot focuses on Wil, short for Wilhelmina, an obviously talented Manhattan-based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing. Referred to just as \"Ma\" in', \"Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.What makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel, act, and generally take care of issues.This isn't one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them.In here, as he is telling his wife about this other lover, she is without emotions, just staring off, with no real reactions whatsoever, a way most would respond.This is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great/perfect.

Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb? Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube\\'s \"reality\" shows and less than funny comedies. Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting? Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did', \"Don't be fooled by stupid commercials that make this movie look inappropriate or like soap operas.

His trio record set the standard in the early days, with Bright Size Life (w. Jaco and Bob Moses), and his PMG work has been unusual and different and refreshing. One reviewer mentions \"cheesy tunes\" - in what sense? In the sense that they don\\'t conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we\\'ve come to expect (swing+sax+trumpet+upright bass + x y and z=jazz)?

At this point I have collected about 17 Pilates programs (along w/ my 90 Yoga programs) and there are certain teachers that have shone above the rest. For me Moira Stott is one of those special teachers that has a way of communicating so clearly and putting together such sound practices that I always look forward to spending time with her programs. I had purchased the four DVD pack w/ \"Basics\", \"Fit and Firm\", \"Secret to Flat Abs\" and \"Sculpt and tone\", and just this morning did \"Fit and Firm\" for the first time.

The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel Jackson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

Having said that, I found myself up very late one night and \"happened upon\" this fine movie. I was mesmerized. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L.

Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be.Thanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.(Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the\", \"OK folks, this is by far one of the best DVDs I've bought in quite awhile.

Well you get more anyway.When I discovered that Mike Nelson from MST3000 fame actually had narrating duty, I just had to buy Reefer Madness again. He's hilarious.

Yes, it can be viewed as a social satire, a political vehicle, etc. That\\'s what makes it a great film, that you can view it from different perspectives.To me the most valuable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see, as in a wide canvass, the soul and mind of this great atheist man. It is revealing that Bu�uel took to the task of \"proving\" religion wrong and absurd with so intense passion and -I would even say- desperation. Because no one is more desperate than he who searches and can\\'t find.

Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude.

Crimes & Misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with Allen's greatest work. Films like The Purple Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall.It's a perfect blend of drama and comedy. In fact, Match Point was kind of a retread of this film. The drama without the comedy. This movie stars Martin Landau ('Ed Wood') as Judah Rosenthal, an eye-doctor (I don't remember the term for one) who's been having an affair with a woman named Dolores (Anjelica Huston, 'Buffalo 66'). Problem is, he's tried to break it off but Dolores isn't having it. She's, instead, threatened\", 'This is such a fun movie to watch. It is so goofy and ridicualous and you never get tired of watching it. Encino Man and Pauly Shore is one of the reasons why the early 90s ruled. There are so many cool scenes in this like when Stoney takes Link to 7-11 and they cruise the aisles looking for some grindeage to munch on. And when they go to the Mountian and ride the Viper in reverse. And the drivers ed scene when Link thinks it is Rad Mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the Mexicans. \"You see that girl muchacho.

It is a pleasure to view this one and recall that movies could be humorous without being decadent; that adventure could be portrayed without endless special effects or digital animation or dissonant \"music\"; and that the more leisurely pace was relaxing :-) Suffice to say that both my wife and I found it very enjoyable! The extra clips were fascinating background on making of the movie: one should not miss reviewing them. The effort spent on the aircraft alone added a considerable touch of reality', '\"Stagecoach\" is significant, along with \"Destry Rides Again\", for redefining the Western for \"adult\" audiences. Director John Ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences. For sure the film does contain a number of Western archetypes(the gambler, the prostitute with a heart of gold, etc.) but they transcend the stereotypes. \"Stagecoach\" is also significant as the film that broke John Wayne to mainstream audiences. Wayne\\'s entrance as the Ringo Kid is the stuff of legends. There is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated Claire Trevor as the social pariah, Dallas, and Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone, for which he won an Oscar. The film\\'s status as being historically significant is not debatable. As first class entertainment it is timeless', \"What do you get when you have rock the devil's son and Adam Sandler pLaying the devil's son?You get Little Nicky.This is the strangest movie Adam Sandler has possibly ever played in.You have two of the devil's sons who want to be the devil themselves and you have Nicky the nice as can be son.The devil doesn't think any of his children are good enough to take his place yet until he tells them otherwise.Little Nicky could care less but his two brothers are outraged.Rioting and leaving hell.Making it impossible for souls to enter or leave.All except for Nicky.He must leave his do gooder life and head to Earth and save his father and all the humans in general.Having a left hell he now has only himself and a little dog companion (Beefy).Nicky has to learn to live\", \"This is a fun &quot;art house&quot; movie. Fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director. Just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house: not a message movie like many such films but instead in-your-face film making - and three cheers for that. Campbell Scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) on how to get laid. The action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping. This script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by Scott's character.

The story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired-hand into murdering her much older husband. Based on the novel by James M.

Over half a century later, we are still singing it's praises.From Lana Turner's memorable entrance as Cora Smith (clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres), the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills.

Frank's a pretty rough and tumble sort of guy; he's a little lazy and a bit of a con artist, but he's decent enough and soon he gets offered a job in a diner run by Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway).

I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.I especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully...\"They don\\'t even know what it is to be a fan.

Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson's lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines\", 'What happens when you title a movie \"Mind the Gap\" and lead the credits with Alan King?

Angel Heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective, Harry Angel and Lou Cyphere, obviously the devil. Well, not obvious to me at first...ha!

Voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a \"devil\" character since there is no devil figure in voodoo.

Andy Garcia surely deserved an Oscar nomination. He was simply great. I was not a big fan of his, but here he clearly impressed me. Of course, he was also terrific in \"The Godfather Part 3\". Meg Ryan was effective, but still a little too cutsey, with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films. But the two daughters were outstanding, especially the older one, played by Tina Majorino, who appears to be about 7 or 8.

His estate is confiscated, his Mother and sister thrown into prison. His accuser is a Roman officer named Messala (Stephen Boyd), Judah's best friend since childhood.

Gene Simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his KISS type persona and plays the evil genius well.

In his over the top performance as an Italian who might have been Vito Coreleone had the Don chosen to go straight, Robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug Biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations.

There are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20's. Keaton's characters move in the real world, with real things, and that's part of what makes them lasting and unique.

Viewers, Beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among Dick Cavett and his guests.

Near the end of Turchin's book, about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires, he quotes extensively from the parts of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Tolstoy, with his ratio analysis of various Napoleon Grand Arme\\x1a metrics to Russian army metrics, was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time.

The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire.He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways.

In short, although there is nothing to match the astounding \"Persona\" (1966), the films do give a great indication as to Bergman\\'s filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general.

Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema, it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands. Verhoeven's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions. Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation. His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate.

Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do. Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role. Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films.

It would not be the last time Karloff played a Chinese, as he later starred as Mr. Wong in Monogram's low budget detective series later in the decade. The plot concerns a race between good guy Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. If Fu Manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which,\", 'In my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short\\'s humor with the exception of, \"Clifford\".

It features several shorts with cartoons and different characters. My favorite part of the video (and my daughter's) is the part featuring Ernie and Bert.

Bert just wants to know if he is healthy, and after putting him through several tests, Ernie says that he doesn't know if Bert is healthy or not because he isn't a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not!

Set in London circa 1910, Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill. One day as he stumbles home drunk, he smells gas, and rescues a young girl (Claire Bloom) from a suicide attempt. He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career. Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat, Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past, including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano (it was both their swan songs). The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self-importance, with a number of references to Chaplin's carrer in pictures alluded to. But there's intelligence, too,\", \"Many shows have their moments, but this is the first show I've ever laughed OUT LOUD, multiple times in one episode.

The series has a \"love it or hate it\" reputation, but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons. Young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure, while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters, and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time. It\\'s no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama\\'s magnum opus, and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series.

(It was directed by Jean Renoir, so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation, but it was exceptionally good.) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors, I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized (the prison rooms looked like slightly-dingy hotel rooms, and the treatment of the prisoners.)However, one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars.

These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way.

Over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan, or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. The opposite holds true as well, chill the pan and it will retain its chill for', \"This pot rocks.

The coconut oil seems to season without coloring so much and this is the first time in a very long life that I've correctly seasoned a pan.

Because the mat is flexible, the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch. Dipped chocolates don't stick, nor does fondant.

It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional.

I've only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I'm more interested in function than appearance.

You want to form a complete seal to prevent leaks and retain heat, but the seal gets tighter as the contents cool and shrink.Don't fill past the raised metal fill-line on the inside of the mug. If you overfill the mug, some liquid will be pushed up into the threads when you screw the lid down, and you won't notice until you tip the mug.

It is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind. My problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke.

It's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I'm optimistist. We choose it for it's simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it's early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I've seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don't want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It\", \"We had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut. I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd. So I called Cuisinart for warranty service. They said they'd replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks. In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem! So I wasn't going to ship the oven to NJ - until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out. Hmmmm. Anyway, we're enjoying this toaster oven very much and use it practically every day. It is slower than a\", 'The lounger is unique and can be used for watching TV or playing with games.', 'I love this thing! Not only does it perform beautifully, but it\\'s absolutely gorgeous. I prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters.I waited a pretty long time (almost a year) before writing my review to make sure I abused it enough. This is my 2nd review.Because it\\'s well made, it\\'s pretty heavy...that\\'s why the \"helper handle\" is so helpful. We have a chicken salad about 4 times a week so I wanted a really big pan to be able to sear my chicken all at once without having to work in shifts. To clean and sanitize stuff, I put EVERYTHING in the dishwasher...vacuum attachments, toothbrushes, dog and cat toys etc...so the fact that this fits in my dishwasher is awesome for me. I wash it by hand about 1/2 the time. The', 'I totally love this pan!I bake cakes all the time using this and other Hoffritz pans and they are absolutely wonderful. I was first impressed by the weight of the pan, the non-stick sufrace, and the even heat distribution. I noticed a remarkable difference in the quality of my cakes from the very first time I used the pan. Not only do my cakes look and taste great, I never have to worry about my cakes getting stuck to the pan or being lopsided.I\\'ll never buy a cheap pan again. It\\'s really is worth the extra couple of dollars. I doubt I\\'ll ever have to replace any of the pans I\\'ve bought from them. I also purchased the Hoffritz springform pans and 9\" rounds, same great results', 'I have owned this for years and LOVE it. The directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee, you add 5 cups of water and let it sit (for hours). I actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine. I fill my ice cube trays with the coffee, then bag the cubes so that I can use it over time. It is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water (American coffee) or less for stronger coffee (e.g., espresso). I particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee -- it comes out nice and strong, not watered down.A final bonus to the toddy maker: used coffee grounds are a folk remedy for fire ants. If you have them and you want them gone without', 'The skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time. The quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet. Its much better then using teflon... (Did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds, especially parrots) Well I never liked cooking in teflon and I have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me. I am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection. Its important to realize, looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven... Those same skillets are still in use today.. Try so to the same about', 'What a delightful gadget - works as advertised (how unusual)! Creates nice slices of mango without the mess and without ending up with all the small slivers of fruit you normally get. Love it', 'I\\'d purchased the \"big brother\" to this KitchenAid cutting board about a year ago, so I understand the frustration of the reviewers who complain about the apparently unremoveable label. (It sounds petty until you try to scrape it off yourself.) The label DID eventually come off, but it did take a bit of muscle.So I\\'m glad to say that this board arrived, a month or two ago, with no sign of a nasty Kitchenaid label at all. No more wrestling with my kitchen equipment for ME!And, like the larger version of this cutting board, this one really is excellent. It really is non-stick, even when the board is wet (such as when you rinse off the tomato goop before you cut up the scallions). It cleans easily and quickly, and has no objection to the dishwasher. Plus, it', 'We purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house. At 14, he is the oldest of 5 - all indoors. We put it on the bed (his favorite daytime nap spot). He loves it, but so do the other four. They all try to squeeze in on it, with him, or take it over when he gets up. It\\'s never empty! It has a bit of a \"crinkly\" noise but they don\\'t seem to mind it after they try it. It seems to work great and very easy to keep clean. The patterned side can be de-furred with a few quick swipes of your hand, following the direction of the fabric nap. Good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats', 'Great thing to own and very useful for cooking small quantity of foods. I use it a lot', 'These beautiful square dishes were the inspiration for my purchase of a complete service for 12 plus serving pieces. I love them! They have a very contemporary look, and they are very durable. What is also nice is the fact that they are larger than your average luncheon/salad plate too', \"This Corelle set has that handcrafted italian detailed look but without worrying about everyday wear-and-tear. It's time to retire my old butterfly pattern which I've had for decades. I rate it four stars only because it would be so much more practical to sell these in SETS OF SIX. It's more profitable for Corelle but not so practical for us. Yes the bowls are shallow and the mugs are stoneware so they are not break resistant.\", 'I have, and do use, many different fillet knives but needed one for knife block in the kitchen. It had to match my other 4 stars. It not only matched but the construction if great and is an excellent performer', \"My friend purchased the Breadman Panini Maker a few months ago. Every time we spoke he was making some kind of Panini sandwich. He raved about this panini maker so I had to get one for myself. I LOVE IT! It is so easy to clean. It is such a wonderful item that I would've paid double the price if I new how well it worked. It's hard for me to believe that anyone could be disappointed with this item.\", 'These are well-made spoons, not junky at all, which is always a possibility with cheap, mail-order items of this type. The steel is heavy-gauge, and all the edges are rounded and safe. Good value and a good way to &quot;top up&quot; an order', 'This little unit is very versatile, you can use it to steam anything', \"This sturdy nylon whisk, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.Its elegant, stylized shape fits seamlessly with the rest of the OXO Good Grips collection and is designed to the let flow the most air into your creams, meringues, custards and frostings for fluffier, even results. This is also a great tool for whisking directly into the saucepan on the stove, since its non-abrasive nylon materials are safe to use on\", 'I have owned at least six other coffee pots and was never satisfied with home made coffee, so Dunkin Donuts was where I would head to on my way to work. I got this coffee pot and I buy Dunkin Donuts coffee and grind it with the Proline Kitchenaid Grinder and it is the best coffee I have ever had. Recently I had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from Dunkin Donuts. I asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots. Well, I assured him he would love it. After having my coffee, for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee, actually said, he', 'If you\\'re like myself, the 5 a.m. pot of coffee has to be simple.Well designed makers keep it almost idiot proof.

They are quieter than other HEPA air filtration units we have had, do a better job of cleaning the air, and have excellent product support.', \"Even on its highest setting, it isn't very loud. Handy electronic screen shows how much longer it is until the filter needs to be washed or vacuumed. I used to wake up in the mornings because I had a stuffy nose due to all the dust where I live, and now that's gone.

Pros:-The 20 oz. size makes it perfect for a college student sitting down to write a paper or read a book - or for that matter, anyone who will be seated for the next hour and needs some comfort while doing it.-The vibrant red is warming, comforting, and beautiful. -This mug is not to heavy to comfortably hold, full of liquid, with one hand.-It insulates well so that fingers aren't overheated while holding it.Cons:-This is not related to the mug itself, but the shipping costs are monstrous. Buy at least two if you buy one - I wish I had. It comes in a rather oversized box\", \"A fork is a fork, right? This does what you'd expect.
